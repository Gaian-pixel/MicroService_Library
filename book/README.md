----Books Microservice---- 

This microservice allow the basic CRUD operation over the books database
In this configuration MongoDb is deployed locally. 

#To recreate the enviroment on your machine, you have to:

-Install mongosh locally.

-run this command -> use book_db.

-run the Book app.

-lunch PostMan and start checking the correct functioning of the crud operation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#So here my new milestone to reach:

-Adding a test ui to simulate a real application.

-Adding the borrowing and the customer service.
