1) The swagger: 
Swagger is a set of rules (in other words, a specification) for a format describing REST APIs. The format is both machine-readable and human-readable. 
As a result, it can be used to share documentation among product managers, testers and developers, but can also be used by various tools to automate API-related processes.
Swagger aims to cover the more common design patterns while being simpler to write and use.


What is a docket object?
A builder which is intended to be the primary interface into the swagger-springmvc framework. Provides sensible defaults and convenience methods for configuration.

Book db structure:

CREATE TABLE book (bookId VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       author VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, publisher VARCHAR(50), pageNumber int);
       
       INSERT INTO book(bookId, title, author, publisher, pageNumber) VALUES('0000000000','Gio Adventure','Gai Giorgio','Mondadori',234);
       

VOLUME MOUNTIG BUG AND docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:

-The volume mount won't be executed becouse the mount directory alrady exits (i don't know why {no error wil be lunched})
-THe entrypoint script will be completly ignored

if i delete the already existing db service (sudo docker volume rm customer_postgres_data), it will'finally start the mount and consequently
start the entrypoint script.
However the latter will fail (maybe beacouse i have previusly runned the lab-2 docker compose and it will try to execute the postgres order database schema.sql)

/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: running /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/schema.sql
customer-postgres | CREATE DATABASE
customer-postgres | 2021-11-26 22:40:24.671 UTC [61] FATAL:  database "order" does not exist
